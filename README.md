# Background
This project was created during a Advanced Object-Oriented Programming course in which I explored three different object-oriented programming languages, creating the same project in each to analyze their features. The project was the game of Reversi, a two-player strategy board game invented in 1883.

This is the solution I created and implemented in Pharo Smalltalk, the first language we explored during the course. Smalltalk is likely one of the most influential programming languages that exists, paving the way for the object-oriented languages we know and love today.
